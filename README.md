> [!WARNING]
> Recursive is important as we use many submodules! If you forget to do this, ensure that you run the 3rd command from here where we run `git submodule update --init --recursive`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MeetSidekick/pcb --recursive sidekick-pcb
```

```bash
cd sidekick-pcb
```

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Now open KiCad, navigate to `File` -> `Open Project` and select this project. 


> [!TIP]
> We have recently migrated from the old repo, please use this. The releases prior to `v0.5.1` can be found at: https://github.com/MakerSidekick/pcb/releases/
